This section determines the standard errors for the coefficients of the
covariates based on 50 bootstrap samples.

1) Run 'Real_data_Boot_50.m' for generating 50 bootstrap datasets and compute 
 standard errors.

2) Generated 'se_Real_ALL_BETA_EST.csv' provides the standard errors of the 
 covariate coefficients, noted in Table 7 of MSiCOR draft/paper.

3) Generated 'se_Real_ALL_EST_proportions.csv' provides the standard errors of the 
 estimated mixture proportions.
