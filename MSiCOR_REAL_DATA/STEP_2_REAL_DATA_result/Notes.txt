I was giving a read about inclusion of covariates in mix markov model.
 In page 8 of "seqHMM.pdf", near equation (9) it explains how to incorporate
 covariates. For each patient there should be a set of covariates 
(not dependent on time). 

But after reading the description of  how to incorporate covariates
 in "seqHMM_package.pdf" under "build_mmm" function, it seems there
is no way to input covariate values. It only allows to include coefficient values which is k x l where k = number of covariates and l = number of clusters. But our input variable should be a n x k matrix (since n =number of patient, k= number of covariates).

One way to estimate ONLY the coefficients is by using "estimate_coef"
 function (page 20 of seqHMM_package). But we need to estimate them
 simultaneously.
