This section performs the simulation experiment using MSiCOR+RMPS
to perform clustering MMM with covariates.

1) Run 'FINAL_SIMULATION_100_rep.m' to perform simulation study.

2) Run 'SUMMARY.m' to summarize results based on 20 replications.

3) Generated 'ZZZ_AAA_BETA_EST_num_clus_3_numiters_20.csv' file
 summarizes estimated coefficients and standard errors based on
 20 iterations, noted down in Table 3 of MSiCOR paper/draft.

4) Generated 'ZZZ_AAA_EST_proportions_3_numiters_20.csv' file
 summarizes estimated proportions for each cluster, noted down 
 in Table 4 of MSiCOR paper/draft.
